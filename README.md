## What are the dotfiles?

> **Dotfiles** are used to customize your system.
> The “dotfiles” name is derived from the configuration files in Unix-like
> systems that start with a dot (e.g. `.bash_profile` and `.gitconfig`).
> For normal users, this indicates these are not regular documents,
> and by default are hidden in directory listings.
> For power users, however, **they are a core tool belt**.

So, in other words, this is a repository which contains my configurations for
the programs in my core tool belt.

:warning: Please be careful if you decide to play with my tools… :wink:

## Getting started

The goal is to be able to run the installation without any requirements.
The installer is supposed to take care of everything in advance,
to automate the processes.
