## Learning notes

### NOTE: NOT case-sensitive

You can write any commands, options, variables in **any case**.
Example:

```powershell
$eXamPleVarIabLe = "Hello World!"
wRite-hoSt "$exampleVARIABLE" # output: Hello World!
```

### Q: How to expand Windows Environment Variables?

A: The variables we know from Windows command line _(`cmd`)_ surrounded by
percentages `%ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE%`,\
**in PowerShell can be expanded by using `$Env:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE`**.

---

### Q: What is a "cmdlet"?

A:
> `cmdlet` _(command let)_ is a **special type of command provided in the
> PowerShell command line environment**.
> They allow users to put certain enhanced operating system functions into
> effect. \
> Cmdlets are especially useful when used as part of a script or batch file,
> but they can also be typed at the command prompt. \
> **Their command names take the form of a capitalized verb-and-noun pair
> conjoined with a dash, for instance, `Get-Help`**.

**More information**: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-overview/>

**NOTE:**
To list all of the available **cmdlets**, use the following command:

```powershell
Get-Command
# or, shorter with alias
gcm
```

Or, find by name, like this:

```powershell
Get-Command -Name "New*"
```

And to print information about specific cmdlet _(like `man` on Linux)_:

```powershell
Get-Help "Get-Command"
```

A: A self-contained reusable unit that allows you to partition, organize,
